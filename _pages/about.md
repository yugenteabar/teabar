  Yugen Tea Bar offers some of the world’s finest loose leaf teas, and their
  stories, curated with inquisitiveness and respect. Teas are paired with
  impossibly beautiful patisserie which tantalisingly changes with the season.
  And it’s all presented with effortless, relaxed humility.


  We are located on the ground floor of Capitol Grand, a hive of culture and
  culinary delights in the heart of South Yarra, on the corner of Toorak Road
  and Chapel Street.


  Yugen Tea Bar melds the talents of Melbourne-born Executive Pastry Chef John
  Demetrios, globe-trotting Tea Sommelier Thibaut Chuzeville and Culinary
  Director, Stephen Nairn.


  Whether you’re a tea aficionado, or simply someone that loves a spot of tea
  and cake, we have something for everyone.
