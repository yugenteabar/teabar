#### What is personal information?

When used in this policy, the term "personal information" has the meaning given to that term in the Privacy Act.

In general terms, personal information is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, address and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information.

If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from the personal information provided it, the information will be considered personal information.

#### How does LK Hospitality collect and hold your personal information?

LK Hospitality will only collect personal information about you by lawful and fair means. LK Hospitality collects personal information in a variety of ways. It is LK Hospitality’s usual practice to collect personal information directly from you (or from your authorised representative), for example when:

1. you attend a LK Hospitality event; or
2. you enquire about or reserve a table; or
3. you contact us by telephone, mail, email or online; or
