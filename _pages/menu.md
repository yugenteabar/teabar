      Yugen's afternoon high tea is inspired by the classic English afternoon
      tea, with some bold twists and turns. Let our tea sommeliers and pastry
      artists craft a Yugen moment for you to remember.


      Each service is comprised of two acts - one savoury (think dainty
      sandwiches and seasonal bites), and one sweet (pastries and scones with
      condiments), served with a carefully matched infusion, brewed and poured
      at your table.


      To enhance your experience, we offer a selection of alcohol-free
      beverages, cocktails and Champagne. Refined yet relaxed, the moment is
      yours to create.
