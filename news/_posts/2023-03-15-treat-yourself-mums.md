It can be hard to find the perfect gift for mum.

But believe us when we say, an afternoon tea with botomless sparkling , high quality tarts and specially curated loose-leaf teas is exactly what she will love. After all the years of burnt toast, cold english breakfast tea and necklaces made out of pasta, an afternoon of true indulgence is the perfect gift.

Send her off to afternoon tea with her friends or make it a gift for yourself to and take her along yourself. At $120 a head, choice of either bottomless sparkling rose (+$30) or bottomless cold brew.
