#### 3\. Changes and Cancellations by you
Faulty product returns
We aim to provide you with products of the highest standard and quality. If you have received a product with a
defect, or the product does not match its description or perform its function, please contact
info@yugenteabar.com.au as soon as possible so we can guide you through the returns process and help resolve the
problem as swiftly as possible.

In order to assist the return process, you may be required to send us images of the damage, defect or fault for
assessment or other details as reasonably required. You may be asked to provide further information to support your
claim to assist us with our assessment of the goods.

If the product is confirmed to have a defect, we will replace or repair the product (if repair is reasonably
possible) or refund the price of the product to your original payment method, as appropriate.

If the product is confirmed to have a major defect, you are entitled to elect whether you want us to replace or
repair (if repair is reasonably possible) the product or refund the price of the product to your original payment
method.

It does not constitute as a defect if in our reasonable opinion a product has become of unacceptable quality
following the sale to you due to fair wear and tear, misuse, failure to use in accordance with manufacturers’
instructions, using it in an abnormal way or failure to take reasonable care.

Perishable foods
Without limiting your rights under these terms or the Australian Consumer Law, no change of mind changes or
cancellations will be accepted for perishable foods (other than unopened pre-packaged teas) after receiving the
order confirmation.

Teas and tea-ware
In addition to your rights in relation to faulty products and subject to the restrictions set out below, you can
return any fully price (non-sale price) product (including unopened pre-packaged teas) within 14 days or receipt of
the order confirmation email:

if the goods are not sale items;
if the goods are unused and in a saleable condition with the original tags still attached; and
in the original packaging, which must be in the original condition, including sealed boxes, branded dust bags and
shoe boxes.
To ensure these returns are assessed and processed swiftly, please follow the instructions set out under 'How do I
return an item’.

Upon receiving and inspection of your return, we will contact you about next steps. Once determined the return is in
compliance with these Terms, we will refund the price of the product returned to your original payment method.

Other than in a case of a faulty product, we will not refund any delivery fees that you have paid at purchase to
have the product shipped to you, or the cost of any packaging you provide to send the items back to us.

How do I return an item?
We make to make sure that you are 100% happy with your purchase.

If you would like to make a return or exchange in accordance with these Terms, you may return or exchange the
product:

at the Yugen Tea Bar store, you can pop into Yugen Tea Bar, 605 Chapel Street , South Yarra VIC 3141 (located inside
Capitol Grand) during business hours. Please ensure you that you include a copy of your receipt; or
via the website, please contact our customer service team by emailing info@yugenteabar.com.au. Please ensure that
you have your order number.
Please note that other than for confirmed faulty products, we do not cover postage costs.

Once we receive and process your return, you will receive a confirmation email that your refund has been processed.
Once processed, you will receive your refund within 10 business days.

General
Nothing in these Terms are intended to exclude any rights relating to faulty product returns or any of your
statutory rights as a consumer under the Australian Consumer Law.

If we allow you to cancel or change your order, your original payment will still be processed. Our customer service
team will then determine whether you are eligible for a refund in accordance with these terms.

We reserve the right to conduct and implement fraud detection processes, including validating your credit card
details. If your nominated payment method triggers our fraud prevention protocols, we may ask you to confirm
additional details, or rescind the transaction. In this case, your order must pass our fraud prevention protocols
before it will be fulfilled. If you do not provide the requested information, your order will be cancelled and
payment returned, if applicable, to the method you originally paid.

Changes & Cancellations by us
If we are unable to fulfil your order due to unforeseen circumstances, or if one of the products is no longer
available, we may contact you to cancel or vary your order.

In such a case, we will determine whether it is appropriate to:

replace the unavailable item with another item of a similar value;
provide a partial refund of the price of the unavailable item;
cancel the entire Order and provide a full refund; or
provide another form of compensation that we deem appropriate.
Any approved refunds will be handled by our customer service team as set out in these Terms.

Delivery Type
Perishable foods - collecting your order
Please arrive at the Yugen Tea Bar located at 605 Chapel Street , South Yarra VIC 3141 (located inside Capitol
Grand) at the pickup time and let a member of the team know the name attached to the order.

To collect your order, a member of our team will require you to present your order confirmation.

We will endeavour to have your order ready to collect at the pickup time, but please be patient if there is a short
wait due to high demand at the time.

Teas and Tea-ware
In addition to having the option to collect your order at the Yugen Tea Bar, for teas and tea-ware, we offer regular
and express delivery through Australia Post.

We aim to deliver products to you at the place of delivery requested by you within the time indicated by us at the
time of your order, but we can’t absolutely guarantee firm delivery dates or times. To the extent permitted by law,
we will not be liable to you for any losses, liabilities, costs, damages, charges or expenses arising out of late or
delayed delivery.

We will aim to leave the order at the address advised by you at the time of purchase. You must ensure that you are
able to take delivery of the product without undue delay and at any time reasonably specified by us.

Our delivery partners may contact you via SMS prior to delivery to provide you with different delivery options,
including giving 'authority to leave’ the item at the address, or have delivery re-routed to a collection point.
Alternatively, the courier may leave a card requesting your instructions on either re-delivery or collection from
the carrier or a collection point.

By default, you provide authority to leave items at the address specified in your order. If the delivery driver, in
their discretion, deems the area unsafe, your order will be redirected to a collection point, redelivered in the
next delivery run (where available) or returned back to our fulfilment centre. If delivery or collection is delayed
through your unreasonable refusal to accept delivery or if you do not (within two weeks of our first attempt to
deliver the product to you) accept delivery or collect the product from the carrier, then we may (without affecting
any other right or remedy available to us) do either or both of the following:

charge you for our reasonable storage fees and other costs reasonably incurred by us; or
no longer make the product available for delivery or collection and notify you that we are cancelling the applicable
order, in which case we will refund to you any money paid to us in accordance with our returns policy, less our
reasonable administration charges (including for attempting to deliver and then returning the product, and any
storage fees and other costs provided for above).
Please note that it might not be possible for us to deliver to some locations, nor are we able to offer equivalent
delivery options to locations that we do service. If we are unable to deliver to your location, we will inform you
on the relevant product page, or alternatively use the contact details that you provide to us when you make your
order and arrange for cancellation of the order or delivery to an alternative delivery address.

Unless otherwise specified by you, all risk in the product shall pass to you upon delivery. If delivery is delayed,
risk shall pass at the date when delivery would have occurred. From the time when risk passes to you, we will not be
liable for loss or destruction of the product.

You must take care when opening the product so as not to damage it, particularly when using any sharp instruments.

Complaints
In addition to the rights and remedies you may have as a consumer under relevant law including the Australian
Consumer Law, if you are not happy with your experience please contact us at info@yugenteabar.com.au and we will
work to resolve your concerns.

Any complaint must be submitted to our customer care team for consideration within 48 hours after the pickup time.
Our team will review your request and get back to you as soon as possible on how we propose to rectify your
experience.

Australian Consumer Law
Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a
replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You
are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the
failure does not amount to a major failure. These rights may be available beyond the rights provided in these Terms.

No resale or third party providers
The online ordering service is only open for orders made on a direct to customer basis. Orders are only accepted on
the condition that the person who places the order must collect the order in person for the purposes of private
consumption. You must not resell or resupply any products ordered via the online ordering service to a third party.

We may refuse, without any refund, any order submitted via the online ordering service which we reasonably believe
has been made by or through a third party delivery business.

#### 4\. Gift Cards
You may use vouchers or gift cards as payment on the website. We may email vouchers and electronic gift cards to
you. We accept no liability for errors in the email address provided to us. We assume no liability for the loss,
theft or illegibility of vouchers. In the event of fraud, an attempt at deception or in the event of the suspicion
of other illegal activities in connection with the redemption of vouchers or gift cards on the website, we are
entitled to cancel your purchase and/or require a different means of payment.

You may purchase gift cards for use on the website by you or other customers. You are responsible for the use and
safety of your gift cards. We are not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from gift cards used without
permission. Gift card purchases may be subject to security checks from time to time, resulting in a longer
processing time.

Gift cards are valid for 3 years from the date of purchase. Any balance that remains after the 3 years will not be
available for use. The credit of a gift card does not accrue interest nor can it be redeemed or refunded for cash.
Gift cards cannot be used to buy further gift cards.

If you place an order less than the value of the gift card, the residual credit can be used for future purchases,
but the residual credit cannot be redeemed for cash. If the credit of a gift card is insufficient for the Order you
wish to make, you may make up the difference through payment by other means.

If an order made using a gift card is cancelled or returned, the portion of the purchase attributable to the gift
card will be refunded as a store credit only. Gift cards are applied on a pro rata basis to each product in an order
for the purpose of establishing refund values.
